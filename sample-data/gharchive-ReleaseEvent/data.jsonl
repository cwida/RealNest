This hotfix addresses a critical issue in the previous release (v2.1.0) where the library failed to statically link due to problems with the fmt library integration. This issue has now been resolved, ensuring smoother integration and usage in your projects.\r\n\r\n### Fixes and Improvements:\r\n\r\n- Static Linking Fix: Resolved the issue where HarmonyLink failed to statically link due to incorrect handling of the fmt library. The build system has been updated to correctly include and link against the necessary fmt headers and symbols.\r\n- CMake Configuration Update: Improved the CMake configuration to explicitly include fmt headers and ensure proper linkage in both shared and static builds.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Changes:\r\n\r\n- Updated the CMakeLists.txt to include the fmt library headers explicitly.\r\n- Ensured the fmt library is linked as a header-only library to prevent symbol resolution issues.\r\n- We encourage all users to update to this hotfix release to benefit from these critical fixes.

If you are new to Python or the Scientific Python ecosystem, we *strongly* recommend you to install and use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). It comes with Spyder and all its dependencies, along with the most important Python scientific libraries (i.e. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, IPython, etc) in a single, easy to use environment.\r\n2. We also support `pip`, but please be aware that `pip` installations are for advanced users with good knowledge of all Spyder dependencies.

Introduction -->\r\nNOTE: THIS RELEASE IS ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR USE ON THE SANCHONET AND PUBLIC TEST ENVIRONMENTS (E.G. PREVIEW) AT THIS TIME. IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE ON MAINNET.\r\n\r\nNode `8.11.0-pre` introduces a number of changes that are needed to prepare for the `Conway` era, as well as other improvements. The hardfork combinator (HFC) has been made more robust and governance actions have been limited for the bootstrap phase. The `PlutusV3` cost model has been added to the `Conway` genesis file.  Network code includes further peer sharing improvements and changes that are related to inbound and outbound governors. Modifications have also been made to the Praos chain order. New API features include the possibility to query the account state, and to estimate and calculate balanced `TxBody`s.\r\nFinally, two new CLI commands have been introduced: `governance action create-hardfork` to generate a hard fork governance action,\r\nand `transaction build-estimate`, to produce a balanced transaction body without requiring a connection to a live node.\r\n  \r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n### Haskell Security Advisory\r\n[Haskell Security Advisory](https://haskell.github.io/security-advisories/)  is a repository of security advisories filed against packages published via [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org).\r\n[cabal-audit](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/148) output:\r\n```\r\nFound advisories:\r\n\r\ndependency \"base\" at version 4.19.1.0 is vulnerable for:\r\n  HSEC-2023-0007 \"readFloat: memory exhaustion with large exponent\"\r\n  published: 2024-05-04 20:52:44 +0200\r\n  https://haskell.github.io/security-advisories/advisory/HSEC-2023-0007\r\n  No fix version available\r\n  toml, parser, dos\r\n\r\ndependency \"process\" at version 1.6.18.0 is vulnerable for:\r\n  HSEC-2024-0003 \"process: command injection via argument list on Windows\"\r\n  published: 2024-05-04 20:52:44 +0200\r\n  https://haskell.github.io/security-advisories/advisory/HSEC-2024-0003\r\n  Fix available since version 1.6.19.0\r\n  windows\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Technical Specification\r\n<details open>\r\n  <summary>Minimum System Requirements</summary>\r\n\r\n- An Intel or AMD x86 processor with two or more cores, at 1.6GHz or faster (2GHz or faster for a stake pool or relay)\r\n- Or, for MacOS, an Apple Silicon (M1, M2 or M3) processor\r\n- 24GB of RAM\r\n- 200GB of free storage (250GB recommended for future growth)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Platforms</summary>\r\n\r\n- Linux 64-bit (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS; Mint 19.3, 20; Debian 10.3)\r\n- Windows 64-bit (8.1, 10, 11)\r\n- MacOS 10.13, 10.14, 10.15, 11\r\n</details>\r\n<details open>\r\n  <summary>GHC/Cabal supported versions</summary>\r\n\r\n- GHC 8.10.7/Cabal 3.8.1.0\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Supported roles</summary>\r\n\r\nPlatform | Block Production | Relay | Client (Desktop)\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nLinux | :green_circle: | :green_circle:  | :green_circle: \r\nWindows | :red_square:  | :red_square:  | :green_circle: \r\nMacOS | :red_square: | :red_square: | :green_circle: \r\n</details>\r\n<details open>\r\n  <summary>Downloads</summary>\r\n\r\n- [Docker image](https://github.com/orgs/IntersectMBO/packages/container/cardano-node/216721062?tag=8.11.0-pre)\r\n- [Configuration files](https://book.play.dev.cardano.org/environments.html)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n- [Cardano Node documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-node)\r\n- [Cardano CLI](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli/blob/main/README.md)\r\n- Internal API docs for [ledger](https://intersectmbo.github.io/cardano-ledger/), [consensus](https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddocks/) and [network](https://ouroboros-network.cardano.intersectmbo.org/)\r\n- [Compatibility matrix](https://docs.cardano.org/release-notes/comp-matrix)\r\n\r\n# Sign off\r\n<!-- Signatures of people responsible for the release -->\r\nRole | Approval\r\n-- | --\r\nCardano Head of Engineering | :green_circle:\r\nCardano Head of Product | :green_circle: \r\nTest Engineer | N/A for pre-release\r\nPerformance Engineer | N/A for pre-release\r\nSite Reliability Engineer | N/A for pre-release\r\nRelease Engineer |  :green_circle: \r\n\r\n# Changelogs\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Node</summary>\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Consensus</summary>\r\n\r\n- Restricted the VRF tiebreaker based on slot distance starting in the Conway era.\r\n- Added GetAccountState query.\r\n- Changed ShelleyLedgerUpdate by replacing `ShelleyUpdatedProtocolUpdates` with `ShelleyUpdatedPParams`.\r\n- Changed the Praos chain order such that for two blocks A and B by the same\r\n  issuer with the same block number, A is now preferred over B only if A\r\n  has a higher issue number and (new) A and B are in the same slot.\r\n  This is in line with the motivation for the issue number tiebreaker, and\r\n  fixes the transitivity of the `Ord PraosChainSelectView` instance in a special\r\n  case.\r\n- Allowed to configure Praos chain order to restrict the VRF tiebreaker based on\r\n  slot distance.\r\n- Updated `BlockFetch` punishment logic for `BlockSupportsDiffusionPipelining`.\r\n- Updated chainSel tentative header logic for `BlockSupportsDiffusionPipelining`.\r\n- Introduced new `ChainOrde` (with `preferCandidate`) class for `SelectViews`,\r\n  and add necessary instances.

This will improve the tree shake if you are building web apps.\n\n  This also requires node16 (see https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports).\n\n  If you are seeing typescript issue `TS2724`('llamaindex' has no exported member named XXX):\n\n  1. update `moduleResolution` to `bundler` in `tsconfig.json`, more for the web applications like Next.js, and vite, but still works for ts-node or tsx.\n  2. consider the ES module in your project, add `\"type\": \"module\"` into `package.json` and update `moduleResolution` to `node16` or `nodenext` in `tsconfig.json`.\n\n  We still support both cjs and esm, but you should update `tsconfig.json` to make the typescript happy.\n\n- 2d8845b: feat(extractors): add keyword extractor and base extractor\n\n## 0.0.48\n\n### Patch
